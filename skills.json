But the fewer children making the journey to school, and the fewer children in educational settings, the lower the risk that the virus can spread and infect vulnerable individuals in wider society.\n<br />\nSchools, and all childcare providers, are therefore being asked to continue to provide care for a limited number of children - children who are vulnerable, and children whose parents are critical to the Covid-19 response and cannot be safely cared for at home.\n<br />\nVulnerable children include children who are supported by social care, those with safeguarding and welfare needs, including child in need plans, on child protection plans, ‘looked after’ children, young carers, disabled children and those with <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/children-with-special-educational-needs/extra-SEN-help\" target=\"_blank\">education, health and care (EHC) plans</a>.\n<br />\nPlease, therefore, follow these key principles:\n<br />\n<ul>\n<li>If it is at all possible for children to be at home, then they must be.</li>\n<li>If a child needs specialist support, is vulnerable or has a parent who is a critical worker, then educational provision will be available for them.</li>\n<li>Parents should not rely for childcare upon those who are advised to be in the stringent social distancing category such as grandparents, friends, or family members with underlying conditions.</li>\n<li>Parents must also do everything they can to ensure children are not mixing socially in a way which can continue to spread the virus. They must observe the same social distancing principles as adults.</li>\n<li>Residential special schools, boarding schools and special settings continue to care for children wherever possible.</li>\n</ul>\n<br />\nYou can find more information on this topic on the <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/coronavirus-covid-19-maintaining-educational-provision/guidance-for-schools-colleges-and-local-authorities-on-maintaining-educational-provision\" target=\"_blank\">UK Government</a> website."
